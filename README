## Xcode Refactoring Plus

I miss the refactoring function in eclipse so i create this plugin to extend the
 current refactoring function of xcode to functionality like move line, delete
 line, duplicate line.

### Delete Line
Delete the line or current selected lines with the keystroke **cmd+D**

### Duplicate Line
Duplicate the line or current selected lines with the keystroke **alt+cmd+down**

### Move Line
Move the line or current selected lines with the keystroke
+ Move Line Down **alt+down**
+ Move Line Up **alt+up**

### Installation
* clone this repo
* build the plugin and it should install at the right directory
* restart xcode

## TODO
+ Package plugin for Alcatraz xcode plugin manager
+ Refactor textview manipulation login into separate class
+ **New Feature : ** Extract Local variable. This is to extract the inline code into local variable within the method.
